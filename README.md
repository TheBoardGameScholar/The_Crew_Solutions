# The_Crew_Solutions
This is a somewhat complex algorithm for generating solutions to The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine, a cooperative trick taking card game.
The game is designed by Thomas Sing and published by KOSMOS
To use the script simply run TheCrew.py, a promt will be given that asks how many objectives you want in the game. The more objectives the harder it is to find a solution.
For an explenation of the algorithm and what still needs work see my blog - https://theboardgamescholar.com/
